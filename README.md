# Matlab-MPU6050-2DVisulization
##Connections :
SCL and SDA to pin number A5 AND A4 to arduino (These are input pins)

VCC to 3.3v pin on arduino and GND to GND of Arduino

=======

Download the I2C and MPU6050 library.

The arduino code is for reading the angle from MPU6050

The matlab code is for generating the 2d visuals taking input from arduino.
